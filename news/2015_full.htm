          <p>Every year it costs more and more money to run a Footy Club. And when you want to be the best all round Club in the League like we do, it costs even more.</p>
          <p>To help us provide the funding to field up to 16 successful sides this year and to drive our major Club goal this year of A Grade success we’ve set our sights on 2 ambitious Sponsorship Targets.</p>
          <p>Click <a href="../sponsors/2015_fhfc_sponsorship_drive.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> to see how you and your business can get involved!</p>

          <p class="newsHeaderLarge">2015 FHFC Senior & Under 18s Season Launch</p>
          <p>Although we are not commencing pre-season training until after Christmas we will be holding a season launch meeting on Tuesday, November the 18th at 7:30pm at FHFC. Rod Mitchell (A Grade Coach) would love to see all players from 2014 and encourage everyone to bring along a mate who could potentially play in the red and blue in 2015.</p>
          <p>The B Grade and Under 18 coaches will be announced on the night as well as new signings plus Jarryd Wallace will present players with pre-season training programs.</p>
          <p>Player-Coach meetings will commence after November the 18th with both the A and B Grade Coaches (An online calendar will be available to book in your meeting timeslot).</p>
          <p>Don't forget that 2015 is 'Back to Flaggy' year and we will be working hard to get our past players either back on the track or at least coming back to the club to support the Falcons.</p>
