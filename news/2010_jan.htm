          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">18th January - 2010 Coaches and Committee Updated</p>
          <p>The 2010 Coaches and Committee contact details have been updated, to view an up-to-date list, please click <a href="../contacts/committee_contacts.htm">here</a>.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="newsHeaderLarge">Welcome to Season 2010 and our new look website!</p>
          <p>The Flagstaff Hill Football Club would like to officially welcome you to Season 2010. Many changes have occurred over the off-season, including coaching appointments, committee appointments, capital upgrades to the community centre and if you haven't noticed a new website.</p>
          <p>After a rather poor performance in the Senior grades in 2009, the club set about making amends in 2010 and implemented an action plan to start the resurrection. One of the first parts of the clubs plan was to appoint a A Grade and Club Coach, after a length interview process the club appointed last seasons Under 18's Coach John Ramage as the man to lead to club into the new decade.</p>
          <p>Along side John the A Grade will have 3 Assistant Coaches, with Craig Burfitt and Saul Abbott currently occupying 2 of the 3 positions, and the third position to be filled in the coming weeks. The B Grade coaching panel has also been changed, with Premiership Under 14's coach Ross Mittiga given the opportunity to take on a Seniors coaching role.</p>
          <p>Our three Saturday Junior teams have also had coaches appointed with A Grade Assistant, Craig Burfitt also taking on the role of Under 18's coach. Last years Sunday Under 16's coach, Graham Tomkins has made the shift to the Saturday Under 16's. While club legend and 319 game player, Andrew Heatley will be the Under 14's head coach.</p>
          <p>In addition to the coaching roles that have been filled, the club has compiled another strong committee for the upcoming season. Adding to the already experience committee are 4 new members: Melanie Stewart, Julie Harrington, Rob Shannon and Scott Roberts. For a full wrap of Season 2009, please view the 2009 Annual Report from the Newsletters section of the Members Area.</p>
          <p>Not only have the off-field teams been hard at work, but the Senior Players have already begun Pre-Season Training. The first session was held on the 17th of November with 60 players making the effort to get to training. All players underwent initial weighing, measurements and time trials for future reference as the Pre-Season rolls along.</p>
          <p>Through grants, donations and fundraising the club has also purchased around $10,000 worth of gym equipment for our new specially developed club gym. The equipment has now been installed and the gym itself is ready for use by any of the senior players. Another fantastic update which occurred during the off-season is the acquisition of brand new tables and chairs for the entire community centre. The football club was instrumental in getting the grant and organising the whole process on behalf of the community centre.</p>
          <p>In the clubs action plan for Season 2010 it was stated that specialist coaches for areas that need improvement within the football club would hopefully improve the seniors performance in the upcoming season. Since John Ramage's appointment as A Grade Coach, the club has also appointed the following coaches and officials for specific areas:</p>
          <p>Ras Atler - Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach (Gym Manager)<br />
            Simon Purchase - Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach (Thursday night training's)<br />
            Darren Webb &amp; Andrew Brockhurst - Skills Coach<br />
            Gav Carey - Tackling Coach<br />
            Craig McMaster - Rehabilitation Coach<br />
            Ollie Meinecke - A Grade Team and Matchday Manager<br />
            Tim Fletcher - A Grade Runner<br />
            Darren Collins &amp; Greg Kearsley - Training Managers<br />
            Ray Mummery - Videographer<br />
            Brett Charlesworth - Football Operations Manager</p>
          <p>One of  Flagstaff Hill Football Club's life members received another outstanding accolade in the past month with Terry Taylor (Father of A Grade Captain, Dermott Taylor) being named the 2009 Auskick Coordinator of the year in South Australia. Congratulations Terry!</p>

          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">New Website Layout</p>
          <p>As you would have already noticed the FHFC Website has undergone a bit of cosmetic surgery since the last update. Hopefully the new design will be easier to navigate, allowing all users to be able to find the information they need quicker and more efficiently.</p>
          <p>Some of the new features include a permanent side bar down both sides of the main content. With the left hand side showing any upcoming matches (for all grades), and any upcoming social events. Down the right hand side you will see a list of some of the clubs Major Sponsors as well as a sub-menu for the page you are viewing (if required).</p>
          <p>Also in the new design is a new footer, which includes direct links to our 'Contact Us', 'About Us' and our 'Frequently Asked Questions' pages. There will hopefully be no major issues with the rollout of this new design but if you notice any errors, or are having troubles using a certain area or page of the site then please use our feedback form on the <a href="../main/contact_us.htm">Contact Us</a> page or directly email us at <a href="mailto:fhfc@internode.on.net">fhfc@internode.on.net</a>.</p>
