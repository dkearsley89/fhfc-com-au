“No”…you want to stay with same words</p>
<p>The tune is exactly the same and the words fit into the tune perfectly!</p>

          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">FHFC Club Survey</p>
<p>*** Survey has been extended until C.O.B Monday 17th of October ***</p>
          <p>Two years ago the Club conducted a survey focusing on the Senior side of the Club. It was very helpful in identifying areas we needed to improve and has played an important part in the significantly better results we saw this year. We intend doing this survey every 2 years. The focus of this year’s survey has widened to include U14's through to Seniors so we get a bigger snapshot of the Club.</p>
<p>The Club Survey has now gone live and can be accessed <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/653546/FHFC-2011" target="_blank">here</a>. It is open right now and will only be kept open until the 17th of October.  It only takes about 10 minutes to complete. Anyone from any area of the Club who has an opinion or point of view they want to share is welcome to do the survey.  The more people the better.</p>
