          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">21st June - Round 10</p>
          <p>Footy returned after the Queens Birthday Long Weekend with the Falcons up against arguably the toughest challenge in the SFL, Morphett Vale. The Sunday sides certainly didn't have an easy opposition either taking on Cove at Flagstaff Oval.</p>
          <p>The Under 14's suffered their second loss in a row at the hands of Morphett Vale bright and early on Saturday morning. The Emus got an early jump and at half time held a comfortable 15 point lead, Flaggies couldn't generate enough scoreboard pressure and eventually went down by 22 points. Brett Turner once again led his team extremely well while Beau Wakely was also a good player for the Falcons.</p>
          <p>Harry Gebhardt and Jarrad Lo Basso led the Under 16's to a final quarter rampage but it wasn't enough to conquer the Emus who snuck home by 19 points. Leading by almost 8 goals at the final break Morphett Vale looked to have the game comfortably in their control, but a gutsy fight back by the Falcons ensured a contest right till the end. Shane Heatley and Jake Ashworth both chipped in with 2 goals each for the match.</p>
          <p>After their disappointing result earlier in the season against Morphett Vale the Under 18's were out to make amends this time around. Luke Abbott led the Falcon charge with 6 goals while Jamie Dell and Matt Bonney played some of their best footy for the season so far. A 5 goal first quarter had Flaggies up and about early in the game and they never looked back, recording a 13 point victory and keeping in touch with the top 4.</p>
          <p>Morphett Vale were far too strong for the Falcons B Grade as the Emus easily accounted for them by 96 points. There were a few positives to comes from the game with several players returning from injury and pushing for A Grade selection in Peter Masika and Simon Murton. Cameron O'Malley also impressed in many different positions throughout the match.</p>
          <p>The A Grade were feeling fresh after a fortnight off and it showed in the first term as they raced out to a two goal lead at the first break. The Emus are far too good of a side to just roll over after one quarter and in the second term they showed just how good they are, kicking 8 goals and keeping the Falcons scoreless. The second half was a repeat of the first with Flaggies winning the third term before the Emus rolled them in the final quarter. Shane Heinrich was best on ground while Leigh O'Malley kicked 2 goals.</p>
          <p>The Sunday 14's had an absolute thriller of a game against Cove, with just 1 point separating the sides at the final siren. A late goal to the Cobras put them infront and unfortunately the Falcons ran out of time before they could respond. While the Sunday Under 16's were outclassed by Cove and ended up going down by </p>

          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">7th June - Round 9</p>
          <p>Both the A and B Grades enjoyed the weekend off with the bye, while the Saturday Junior sides were all playing away from home. A full day of action on the Sunday at Flagstaff Oval with the Subbies, both Sunday sides and club presentations all taking place.</p>
          <p>The Under 14's let a golden opportunity slip to cement itself at the top of the premiership table when it lost by 2 goals to Noarlunga. Both teams failed to impress infront of goal, with 11 points a piece and only 10 goals between the two sides. After being infront by 2 points at the final break the boys managed to only add a further 2 points to the total as they were overrun by the shoes. Campbell Wright was easily the Falcons best player while Daniel Claridge and young Matt Caire were also in the Falcons better players.</p>
          <p>Noarlunga made it two from two when it accounted for the Falcons in the Under 16's match. Flaggies blew a handy lead at half time as the Shoes booted 7 unanswered goals in the third quarter. Matt Macbeth and Brad Draper both played good games but it wasn't enough to get the Falcons over the line as they went down by 23 points.</p>
          <p>For the second week in a row the Under 18's played Aldinga, and it was the same result as the saturday prior with a Falcons victory by 137 points. Matt Bonney and Ben Papps slotted through 4 goals each, while the Falcons also had another 11 individual goal kickers. New player to the club this year, Jeremy Cross was amongst the Falcons best players.</p>
          <p>Both the Sunday Under 14's and Under 16's suffered losses on the weekend in wet and windy conditions at Flagstaff Oval. The Under 16's were in the game for most of the day, but dropped off in the last half to go down to Reynella.</p>
          <p>There will be no games this weekend due to the Queen's Birthday Long Weekend. Enjoy your time away from football and we will see you back the following week!</p>
