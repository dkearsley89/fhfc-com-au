          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">31st May - Round 8 v Aldinga</p>
          <p>Round 8 of the SFL Season was a wet and windy weekend of football with Aldinga traveling to Flagstaff Hill for the Saturday teams and the Falcons going around the corner to Happy Valley for the Sunday teams.</p>
          <p>The Under 14's moved into equal top position on the ladder after a powerful victory against Aldinga in the better of conditions on Saturday. Elliott Modra and Campbell Wright both kicked 3 goals a piece in the 104 point victory. After a steady start the Falcons exploded in the third term to kick 6 goals to 0, with Lachlan Hooper and Nick Hiosan having a lot of the footy throughout the match.</p>
          <p>Flagstaff Hill enjoyed an even bigger win in the Under 16's, only allowing the sharks to score a total of 2 points for the entire match. The 133 point drubbing was set up by Harrison Gebhardt and Shane Heatley who both slotted 4 goals for the Red and Blue.</p>
          <p>Luke Abbott's 9 goal haul helped the Under 18's to a percentage boosting 119 point victory against Aldinga in wet and boggy conditions. Brad Craddock, Sam Napier and Declan White all played great games and will be looking for a repeat performance when they have to play Aldinga again this weekend.</p>
          <p>The B Grade recorded what was in the end a comfortable victory, but they where made to work hard in the stormy conditions. At quarter time the Falcons led two goals to one, but 4 goals in the second term saw Flagstaff Hill extend their lead, thanks mainly to the run of Justin Ayris (3 Goals), Dan Crisa and the ruckwork of Robbie Tedesco.</p>
          <p>For the A Grade to make a move into the top 8 before the mid-season break the Falcons needed to beat Aldinga and gain some much needed percentage. Flaggies came out firing in the first term, booting 6 goals in a surprisingly skillful quarter given the conditions. The second quarter was a mess for both teams, with both the Sharks and the Falcons only putting one goal on the board. The game was sealed in the third term when Shane Heinrich and Matt Carey started to find some more room throughout the midfield, Heinrich finished with 5 goals while Steven Gater and David Stevens also popped up for 3 goals each.</p>
          <p>Although the rain stayed away for much of the Sunday matches the conditions were still tricky for both teams, unfortunately both our Under 14's and Under 16's went down to the Vikings.</p>

          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">25th May - Round 7 v Marion</p>
          <p>Flagstaff Hill traveled down the hill to one of the biggest ovals on the SFL to take on Marion at Ram Park. With the Under 18's having a bye the Under 14's and Under 16's enjoyed a sleep in and later start times for their matches.</p>
          <p>According to coach Andrew Heatley, the Under 14's had a shocker on Saturday morning, luckily for them their opposition was not much better as the Falcons came away with a 22 point victory. In a low scoring affair Campbell Wright was outstanding to score six of the teams seven goals, while Brayden Roberts and Brayden Heywood-Ferors were amongst Flaggies better players.</p>
          <p>The Under 16's had a much easier contest against Marion, Harry Gebhardt, Jess Lemon and Jake Ashworth all chipped in with 3 goals. Captain Mason Buckley was again in the best players while first year player Brendan Hillier also had a solid game. Flagstaff Hill 18.13 (121) def Marion 3.4 (22).</p>
          <p>With the Under 18's having the bye, Flagstaff Hill took the opportunity to blood several players in the B Grade, Brad Craddock and Sam Napier both played exceptionally well in their first senior match for the Falcons. Marion were held goalless for the entire game as Flaggies put 24 goals on the board in an absolute thrashing of the Rams. Dan Crisa continued his great run of form while Brayden Norris and Cameron O'Malley also had great games.</p>
          <p>The A Grade had a must win game against Marion, who coming into the match had not won a game. The first quarter was a tight battle with both teams only managing one goal each, Marion looked the far better side as Flagstaff Hill were lazy and at times complacent. A more determined Flaggies unit managed to get out to a 14 point lead at half time in the low scoring first half. A five minute burst from the Falcons midway through the third quarter extended their lead to over 5 goals before Marion kicked two late goals in the quarter to stay in touch. A strong final term from the Falcons allowed them to hold on for victory by 21 points, with Matt Carey again playing a solid game throughout the middle of the ground. Sam Smith chipped in with 3 goals while Nick Collins and Pete McMaster both kicked 2 goals each.</p>
          <p>The Sunday Under 14's played a gutsy game of football against Morphett Vale in tough conditions to record a 14 point victory and move them to third on the Premiership Ladder. In the Sunday Under 16's match the Falcons never really looked like playing a winning style of football, with Morphett Vale running out easy winners by 79 points.</p>

          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">17th May - Round 6 v Noarlunga</p>
          <p>Flagstaff Hill hosted the Noarlunga Shoes on Saturday in perfect football weather conditions. After positive sings from all teams in the opening 5 rounds the Falcons were eager to come away with a 100% win record for the day.</p>
          <p>At quarter time the Under 14's had failed to register a point on the scoreboard and it looked like the result was all but locked in. That was until Captain Brett Turner led the Falcons to a great resurrection as they kicked 4 goals in the second term to be back in the game. Another three goals in the third quarter gave Flaggies a handy 7 point lead going into the final term, and after a tense final quarter the Falcons came out on top by the smallest or margins. Flagstaff Hill 7.3 (45) def Noarlunga 6.8 (44)</p>
          <p>The Under 16's beat the Shoes by a comfortable 24 points on Saturday and they now sit in 6th position on the premiership table with a 4-2 win-loss record. Tom Breynard was dangerous up forward with 4 goals while Harry Gebhardt was once again impressive with 2 goals and plenty of marks around the ground.</p>
          <p>Craig Burfitt's Under 18's struggled for firepower up forward as they went down by 31 points to Noarlunga. First year Under 18's player Sam Napier and Ross Mummery had good games while opportunist forward Declan White kicked two goals to bring his tally up to 8 for the season.</p>
          <p>Tom South (5 Goals) and Simon Zacpal (2 Goals) played a loan hand up forward for the Falcons as the B Grade lost by 3 goals. A lapse in intensity in the third term allowed Noarlunga to build up a 25 point lead at the final change, and the Shoes were good enough to hold on and keep the Falcons to only 1 win in the B Grade for season 2010.</p>
          <p>After two losses by less than two goals in the past fortnight the Falcons finally were able to crack a tight game open and record their second win for this year. Noarlunga started the better team and the Falcons really had to make the most of their opportunities to stay in touch with the Shoes. Sam Smith was instrumental up forward with 6 majors, while Matt Carey continued his great form as he was easily the best player for the Red and Blue.</p>
          <p>A powerful second half from the Falcons saw them outscore the Shoes nine goals to five, the win was a fantastic result for the team after a hard start to the season they will now be looking to capitalize on their good start and be pushing higher up the Premiership Ladder in the coming weeks.
          <p>The Sunday Under 14's had a huge win against Lonsdale with the Falcons piling on 19 goals to the Lions 3. In the later game the Falcons took on Brighton and were dominated after quarter time, Brighton winners by 116 points.</p>

          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">10th May - Round 5 v Edwardstown</p>
          <p>Flagstaff Hill had a huge chance to come away with all five wins on Saturday against Edwardstown and Hackham, but instead let the opportunity slip through their fingers and only came away with three wins from the Saturday teams.</p>
          <p>The Under 14's started the weekend off in spectacular fashion, crashing the Hawks by over 20 goals. Forward Campbell Wright was once again a force, slotting through 11 goals in the demolition. Brayden Heywood-Ferors and Daniel Claridge were also prominent ball winners for the Falcons throughout the game.</p>
          <p>Graham Tomkins and his Under 16's side bounced back from last weeks loss against Cove to record an easy victory over Hackham. Jack Morallee, Shane Heatley (7 Goals) and Captain Mason Buckley helped the Falcons to their third win of the season and they now sit in 6th position on the Premiership Table.</p>
          <p>For the first time ever Flagstaff Hill took on Edwardstown in an Under 18's match. The first half was a tight tussle with both teams keeping the scoring pressure right up as Edwardstown took a 9 point lead into the major break. The third term saw the Falcons play some of their best football for 2010, as they escaped out to 4 goal lead at the final change. Flaggies eventually won by 27 points with Luke Abbott, Sam Napier and Nick Collins all collecting plenty of disposals during the match.</p>
          <p>25 points separated the B Grade from victory against Edwardstown, and if they didn't waste so much of the ball they would've almost certainly came away with a win. Captain Leigh O'Malley led from the front in his 100th Senior game as did Matt Lendrum and Dan Crisa who also played well for the red and blue.</p>
          <p>In a similar story to the B Grade, the Falcons A Grade side through away a golden opportunity to beat a top 6 side. In perfect conditions on a big Edwardstown oval the Falcons started slowly and never really got out of second gear. A five minute patch in the second quarter saw Flagstaff Hill kick 3 quick goals before dropping their concentration and allowing Townies to do the same just before half time. The Falcons were always in touch with Edwardstown but could never regain the lead and eventually went down by a mere 10 points. Derm Taylor continued his rich vein of form as did Scott Mawer and Matt Carey.</p>
          <p>Flagstaff Hill suffered a big loss at the hands of Cove in the Sunday Under 16's, while the Under 14's narrowly went down by 7 points in a nail bitter of a game.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">3rd May - Round 4 v Cove</p>
          <p>After five wins from seven matches last weekend the Falcons were out to better that record as the Saturday teams took on Cove and the Sunday teams battled Reynella. In near perfect conditions at Flagstaff Oval the Saturday teams toiled hard all day, but only came away with one victory, while the Sunday teams traveled to Reynella and came home with two wins from as many matches.</p>
          <p>Flaggies moved into 4th spot on the Under 14's ladder with a commanding 65 point win over Cove. The first quarter was tightly contested before the Falcons moved up a gear and left the Cobras for dead, keeping them scoreless for the entire second half. Campbell Wright continued his good form to slot through another 6 goals, taking his tally to 21 for the season already. Ruckman Adam Coles once again was amongst the better players while Brayden Heywood-Feros was best on ground for the Falcons.</p>
          <p>The Under 16's blew a 17 point half time lead as inaccurate kicking cost them a chance at victory against Cove. A seven goal third quarter sealed the game for the Cobras as the Falcons had no reply to the second half scoring onslaught. Blaise Tomkins was the only multiple goal scorer for Flaggies with 2 while Vice Captain Jarrad Lo Basso was a major ball winner all day for Flagstaff Hill.</p>
          <p>Saul Abbott took control of the Under 18's on Saturday with Craig Burfitt unavailable to coach. Flagstaff Hill never looked like getting over the line and ended up loosing by 11 goals, conceding 6 goals to just 2 in the final term. Vice Captain Luke Abbott was one of the better players for the Falcons, also kicking 3 goals. Full Back Brad Craddock was once again solid as a rock down back, while small on-baller Peter Golding had one of his better games in the Red and Blue.</p>
          <p>The B Grade certainly came to play on Saturday, giving Cove a contest throughout the entire match. Wasted opportunities and too many turnovers cost the Falcons a chance of victory as they went down by 27 points. Flagstaff Hill will be hoping they can convert their dominance of the play better next weekend when they take on Edwardstown. Cameron O'Malley, Peter Masika and Matt Lendrum were all in the Falcons better players while Jarrad Lee snuck through 2 goals to continue his good form.</p>
          <p>Flagstaff Hill went down by an agonising 11 points to the 2008 Premiers Cove on Saturday. The Falcons came out firing in the first term, putting through 5 goals, but the scoring dried up in the second term as Cove wrestled back the lead at the main break. In a heated contest the Falcons never backed down from the Cove challenge and outscored the Cobras in the last term, but it wasn't enough as Cove ran out winners 11.13 (79) to Flagstaff Hill 10.8 (68). Steve Gater once again was solid in defense and was well supported by Paul Mellen and Shane Heinrich who both enjoyed good matches.</p>
          <p>Both the Sunday Under 14's and Under 16's enjoyed great wins against Reynella on the weekend. The Under 14's got up in a thriller by just 1 point while the Under 16's held on to win by 11 points.</p>
