          <p>At the FHFC we strive to be the best football club in the Southern Football League and beyond - both on and off the field. To do this, we need your ideas and feedback about what we can do to make our club even better.</p>
          <p>In 2008 we launched the 'Falcon Good Ideas Register' and we are proud to say that we have acted on more than 30 of these ideas already. We're launching the register again in 2010, so if you have a good idea, or if you would like to become a valued volunteer please email club President <a href="mailto:brett@charlesworthnuts.com.au">Brett Charlesworth</a> or use our <a href="javascript:popUpScrollbars('../main/feedback.htm','550','300')">feedback form</a>.</p>
          <p>As most of the club would be aware, training has commenced for all grades except the Sub-Juniors. Our goal for all Junior and Senior players and teams is to be the best we can be, and you can't achieve this without a 100% commitment to training. The club has worked hard to provide every player with exceptional facilities, coaches and programs to help you improve your football. Training days and times are as follows:</p>

          <p>At the Flagstaff Hill Football Club we are blessed with many great sponsors and in 2010 more than ever we need the support of all our current sponsors plus an influx of quite a few new ones. Solomons Flooring at Marion have come on board as a major sponsor for 2010 and hopefully beyond. You can find Solomons at the Homemaker centre, 941 Marion Road, Marion, 5043.</p>
