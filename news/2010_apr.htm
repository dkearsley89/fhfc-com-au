          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">27th April - Round 3 v Hackham</p>
          <p>Round 3 of the SFL had the Falcons up against the struggling Hackham Hawks at Hackham, while the two Sunday Junior teams kicked off their season with home matches against rivals Happy Valley.</p>
          <p>Hackham were kept goalless in a one sided affair as the Falcon Under 14's ran out 114 point winners. Campbell Wright couldn't put a foot wrong as he slammed through 10 goals for the match, while Brett Turner once again led his side to victory with a best on ground performance. Lachlan Hooper and Adam Coles were the other major ball winners for Flagstaff Hill.</p>
          <p>The Under 16's had a mammoth 14 goal kickers throughout their match against the Hawks and if it weren't for inaccurate kicking in the first quarter they may have increased this figure. Tom Breynard and Mason Buckley were amongst the best players, and while the goals were shared Jake Ashworth, Jack Mittiga, Jordan Wayne and Blaise Tomkins all managed to kick 3 majors for Flaggies.</p>
          <p>Although the Falcons were never really challenged in the Under 18's, they were miles away from playing at their best. New player to the club Ben Cross was once again in the best players while dangerous forward Luke Abbott fired again, sending through 4 goals. Final scores were Flagstaff Hill 12.12 (84) def Hackham 3.3 (21).</p>
          <p>Captain Jarrad Lee led his team with a bag of goals as he and Matt Hagias both kicked 9 in an absolute thrashing of the Hawks. Even in blustery conditions the B Grade managed to only kick 6 behinds for the whole game as they piled on 35 goals at an astonishing 85% accuracy. Thomas Chapman continued his push for a return to the A Grade this season with another wonderful display through the Falcons midfield.</p>
          <p>There is no doubt that Hackham's A Grade have improved on years gone by, but even with their improvement the Falcons managed to notch up a 115 point victory. Dermy Taylor and Cameron Dienelt provided plenty of run for the Falcons while Sam Smith finished well in front of the big sticks for a return of 6 goals. Next weekend will be a much bigger challenge as Flaggies take on the Cove Cobras at Flagstaff Oval.</p>
          <p>The SFL Sunday Competition kicked off on Anzac Day as both the Under 14's and Under 16's took on Happy Valley. Flagstaff Hill didn't come away with any points but there were plenty of positives in their first competitive outing for Season 2010. In the 14's Blake Files had plenty of the footy while also kicking 2 majors, while in the 16's Cameron Van Den Bos kicked 3 goals and was a stand out in his first match for the Falcons.</p>

          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">19th April - Round 2 v Reynella</p>
          <p>Flagstaff Hill had their first away match for the year, with all five Saturday teams taking on Reynella at Oval Road. After mediocre results from Round 1 the Falcons really needed to come out firing against the powerful Wineflies.</p>
          <p>Last week the Under 14's took care of the Bombers by 28 points and the boys were looking for a similar result when they took on Reynella bright and early on Saturday. Reynella came out with all guns blazing and smashed the Falcons in the first half, 7 goals to 2.</p>
          <p>After the main break  the boys put in a great effort  to reel the margin in. The first half lapse really cost the young Falcons, going down in the end by just 11 points, Captain Brett Turner was once again amongst the best players while also kicking 4 goals.</p>
          <p>The Under 16's finished 25 point winners in their match against Reynella and had it not been for inaccurate kicking, they could have won by an even bigger margin. Flaggies blew the Wineflies away in the third quarter, kicking 3 goals to 1. Ruckman Huw Channing was the Falcons best player, while Jordan Wayne slotted home 4 majors up forward.</p>
          <p>The highlight of the day was a 30 minute patch of football by the Under 18's that put the game out of Reynella's reach. With the game tightly locked early in the second quarter Jake Borlace came from nowhere to kick 3 goals in as many minutes as he and the rest of the team pulled away from Reynella. Flaggies running out winners by 26 points.</p>
          <p>In Round 1 the B Grade were easily outclassed by Brighton and for parts of this weeks match the same could be said about Reynella. Flagstaff Hill were much more competitive than last week but still fell short by 79 points, best for the Falcons were Kyle Petty and Leigh O'Malley.</p>
          <p>For the second week in a row the A Grade proved that they are competitive with the top sides, the boys played some great football but also had some momentary lapses which ultimately cost them in the end. Playing in the ruck, Kane Abbott sneaked in three goals and was among the best players while last weeks best player Matt Carey once again showed that when fit he is one of the best in the Falcons jumper. The final scores were Reynella 19.13 (127) def Flagstaff Hill 9.8 (62). </p>

          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">13th April - Round 1 v Brighton</p>
          <p>Season 2010 has officially started for the Falcons as they hosted one of the best clubs in the SFL, the Brighton Bombers at home on Saturday the 10th of April. After a long, hard and successful pre-season the players were ready for a challenge, unfortunately Flaggies were only able to snatch one victory for the day in the Under 14's.</p>
          <p>Former club champion and multiple Association Medal winner, Andrew Heatley took the charges of the Falcons Under 14's for the first time on Saturday morning, and after being in front by 1 point at three quarter time they finished the game full of run to overpower the Bombers by 28 points. Adam Coles and Captain Brett Turner were the best for Flaggies, while first gamer Bradley Patterson slotted home 3 goals to also be amongst the best.</p>
          <p>Last year's Sunday Under 16's coach, Graham Tomkins has taken the reigns of the Saturday side and almost started 2010 with a big scalp. After starting the game well the Falcons held the lead at the first break by a slender 2 points, but Brighton managed to slowly build a lead and despite a desperate fight back in the last quarter the Bombers got home by 7 points. 2008 Under 14's Best &amp; Fairest winner Matt Macbeth was best on ground, while Jack Morallee was also a standout. In his first game for the Falcons, Jayden Reid kicked 4 majors in a solid performance up forward.</p>
          <p>Coming off a close match against Morphett Vale in their catch up game from before Easter, the Under 18's were keen to notch their first victory for 2010. They were up against stiff opposition in Brighton and right from the word go they were on the back foot, leaking through six goals to none in the first quarter alone. Flagstaff Hill eventually went down by over 100 points and while the result was not desirable there where a few positives with Ben Cross playing a great game and first year Under 18, Ben Papps kicking two goals and also getting second best for the Falcons.</p>
          <p>The B Grade players and coach Ross Mittiga had a disastrous afternoon against a rampant Brighton outfit on Saturday. Kicking only two goals for the game the B Grade were simply outclassed by last years Premiers, in the end the margin ballooned to over 20 goals. Leigh Ward, Thomas Chapman and Kain Charlesworth all had respectable games but the club will be looking for a much improved effort from Ross and his charges against Reynella this weekend.</p>
          <p>After 2009's poor form, the club took a stance and said it needed to improve the position of the A Grade, the club appointed 2009 Under 18's coach John Ramage as the man to lead the Falcons in 2010. The A Grade showed promising signs throughout it's two competitive trial games and were ready to take on Brighton at full steam. In wet and windy conditions the game was played at a surprisingly good skill level and although Brighton got an early jump on the Falcons they never really looked out of the contest in the first half.</p>
          <p>Going into the final term the Falcons were down by 6 majors and needed to lift their game if they were to push the Bombers right to end, unfortunately Flagstaff Hill dropped off slightly in the last quarter and the score line blew out to 11 goals by the final siren. Although the final score may not have reflected the closeness of the game the Falcons still have a lot to work on if they are to push further and challenge Reynella this coming Saturday. Matt Carey was excellent off the wing for Flagstaff Hill while Sam Smith kicked two goals and was good while rotating throughout the midfield.</p>
