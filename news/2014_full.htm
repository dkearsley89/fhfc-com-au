 <p class="newsHeaderLarge">FHFC Annual Bingo Night</p>
          <p>On Saturday the 5th of July the Flagstaff Hill F.C will be holding its annual Bingo Night. Please see this <a href="../falcon_news/2014/2014_fhfc_bingo.pdf" target="_blank">flyer</a> for full details.</p>
          <p>This is a FAMILY FRIENDLY event that suits Subbies through to Seniors and we would love to see as many people as possible attend. Nat Bunworth will be hosting the evening meal and running her Sweets ‘n’ Treats for a Cure from 6.00pm. All moneys raised will go towards beating Neuroblastoma.</p>
          <p>We are encouraging all families to attend the dinner, stay for club presentations at 7.00pm and then enjoy a night of fun and frivolity at Bingo. This is a great opportunity for Sub-Junior families to be involved with the Junior and Senior teams and we especially encourage Under 12 players and their families who will move to Junior football in 2015.</p>
