          <p class="newsHeaderLarge">Grand Final Week</p>
          <p class="centered"><span class="bold">Grand Final - Saturday</span><br />
            <span class="bold">Under 16's</span> - 9:20am v Cove @ Hickinbotham Oval</p>
            <p>Flagstaff Hill went into the weekend being the only Club out of 15 to have all 5 teams in a Preliminary Final.  We came out the other side with just the one team, our Under 16’s, through to the Grand Final. This Saturday at 9.20am at Hickinbotham Oval (South Adelaide) our 16’s will be facing off against Cove for the rights to be called 2011 premiers. This is the 9th year in a row we have been represented by at least one team on grand final day.  We are aiming for our 8th win in 11 attempts, a very impressive strike rate, and our 16’s are aiming for the rare feat of back-to-back premierships.</p>
            <p>In the last few years Flagstaff Hill has owned the eastern wing of Hickinbotham Oval.  We’ve had huge crowds of red and blue.  We need to reclaim our territory again on Saturday.  We need to take over the eastern wing. There’s no doubt we will have the biggest crowd on the day, but that's not our goal. Constant improvement is one of our 3 core values so our goal is to have the biggest Flagstaff Hill crowd of all time on grand final day. We need to set a new Flagstaff Hill record. And for that to happen we need you there. And we need your family. And we need your friends.  Use Facebook, Twitter, SMS or actually talk to someone but whatever method you choose just be proactive in getting the biggest Flagstaff Hill crowd of all time there.</p>
