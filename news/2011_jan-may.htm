          <p class="newsHeaderSmall">Round 2 Wrap Up</p>
          <p>After the first full round of the SFL's 2011 Season the Falcons are sitting pretty in all grades, albeit after playing one of the cellar dwellers for this year. The Under 18's enjoyed another week off with the bye, while all other grades played Marion at Home on Saturday.</p>
          <p>Craig Bahnisch grabbed his first win as Under 14's coach with a comfortable victory against the Rams in the pouring rain. Liam O'Brien led the goal kicking charts with 3, while several other new players to the club made an instant impression at the Falcons.</p>
<p>The Under 16's carried on from last season's premiership with a crushing 33 goal victory. Shane Heatley showed that he will be an important player for the Falcons this year with 4 goals and plenty more touches.</p>
<p>The B Grade started a bit slow, but under new coach Rod Mitchell they quickly picked up the pace. Jarrad Lee pushed his case for A Grade selection with a few goals in a Best On Ground performance.</p>
<p>John Ramage and the A Grade Squad got off to a good start in Season 2011, with a 20 goal win over Marion. Sam Smith took multiple hangers and slotted through 10 goals in a very entertaining display from the goal square. While down back Steven Gater patrolled his troops and provided plenty of run out of defence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="newsHeaderLarge">Round 2 v Marion</p>
          <p>Season 2011 finally starts this weekend with the club taking on the Marion Rams at the Flagstaff Hill Oval. The Under 18's have the bye first up so the Under 14's and Under 16's will start later than normal.</p>
<p class="centered"><span class="bold">A Grade</span> - 2:30pm v Marion<br />
