<p>Flagstaff Hill Football Club endeavours to maintain the highest standards in Sport Safety and avoiding dental injuries remains high on our agenda.</p>
<p><b>Performance Mouthguards</b> not only protect teeth, but aid in the prevention of concussion due to the excellent design and fit. The Adelaide Crows, Glenelg Football Club and many local amateur clubs and schools are currently protected by Performance Mouthguards.<p>
<p>Performance Mouthguards include five designs (new size for Nippers/ Subbies) suitable for all age groups. Performance Mouthguards are available in a wide range of colours, multi-colours, logos (must be supplied) and stripes if desired. Laminated guards come with the additional feature of having the sportspersons name and telephone number permanently sealed within the guard. Performance Mouthguards are covered by an Unconditional Warranty for manufacturing fault and a Money Back Guarantee if their customers are not able to tolerate the mouthguards.</p>
<p>Performance Mouthguards can successfully construct a mouthguard to fit over orthodontic bands, for this we recommend the Performance Junior Mouthguard. Their very competitive prices can be claimed on dental health insurance, further reducing the cost of the mouthguard.</p>
