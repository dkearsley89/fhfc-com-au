          <p>Welcome to the Flagstaff Hill Football Club website where you will find all of the latest Club news and information.  The Flagstaff Hill Football Club is one of the fastest growing football Clubs in the Southern Football League.</p>
          <div class="centered"><a href="http://goodsports.com.au/" target="_blank"><img src="../pictures/goodSportsLogo.png" alt="" width="500"/></a></div>
		  <p><span class="newsHeaderSmall">Our philosophies</span><br />
             We pride ourselves on our philosophies of <span class="bold">Club spirit, Junior development and constant improvement</span>.  While we are proud of our on-field success of twelve Premierships since 2000 – and of being the grass roots home of AFL players <span class="bold">Adam Cooney</span> and <span class="bold">Danny Meyer</span> - we are just as proud of our off-field success.  We believe in the important role that Clubs play within our community, particularly in teaching important life skills to our players both on and off the field.</p>
          <p><span class="newsHeaderSmall">Saturday and Sunday options</span><br />
             In 2016 the Club will field <span class="bold">three Senior teams (A, B &amp; C grades)</span>, <span class="bold">three Saturday Junior teams (U14s, U16s, U18s)</span>, <span class="bold">two Sunday Junior teams (U14s, U16s)</span>, and <span class="bold">six Sub-Junior teams (2 x U12s, 2 x U10s, 2 x U8s)</span>, as well as a thriving <span class="bold">AusKick program</span>.  Our Sub-Juniors play on Sundays so that Club football doesn't interfere with school commitments.</p>
          <p><span class="newsHeaderSmall">Professional practice</span><br />
             We carefully select our coaching and support staff to ensure we provide all of our players with an <span class="bold">encouraging, enjoyable, successful and safe</span> sporting environment.  We believe that it is the role of our Coaches, Trainers and Team Support Staff to support each player and treat each one of them as a team member and as an individual.  In addition, they have a responsibility to ensure that they build the character of players, as well as their skills and promote good sportsmanship.  We also have expectations of our Players, Officials and Supporters and these expectations are reflected in our Club Conduct Agreements.</p>
          <p><span class="newsHeaderSmall">Community responsibility</span><br />
             Our Club is a member of the <span class="bold">'Good Sports Program'</span> which encourages a <span class="bold">safe and responsible</span> environment for players, families and supporters through the promotion of sensible drinking practices.  Our players are also encouraged to participate in Club activities such as hosting and serving two meals at the Club throughout the season to teach them about the <span class="bold">value of community service</span> within a Club that operates entirely on volunteers.  We also support causes such as the Cancer Council’s 'Call to Arms' which raises awareness about cancer in men and the importance of screening and a healthy lifestyle.</p>
          <p><span class="newsHeaderSmall">Welcoming family environment</span><br />
             The meals program is one of several initiatives at the Flastaff Hill Football Club as we strive for constant improvement and it has been a huge success.  It also provides an opportunity for our new (and regular) families to share a meal with other Club members and for us all to get to know each other better.  We work hard to provide a <span class="bold">welcoming and inclusive environment</span> and our players are strongly encouraged to do the same.</p>
          <p><span class="newsHeaderSmall">Leadership</span><br />
             We are extremely proud of our volunteers.  Our committee reached a record 30 people in 2014, all of whom have a diverse range of <span class="bold">professional skills and knowledge</span> which are adding further to the future development and success of the Club.  We appreciate that our members are busy people so we provide the opportunity for people to be involved on the committee, a sub-committee or even a small one-off project or event – it all helps.</p>
          <p> <span class="newsHeaderSmall">Contact us</span><br />
             We would love to have you and your family <span class="bold">become a part of the Flagstaff Hill Football Club</span>.
