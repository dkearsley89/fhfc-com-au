          <p>Welcome to the Flagstaff Hill Football Clubs Senior page. Here is where you will find all the information associated with the three Senior Falcon teams. If you have any questions that are not covered on this page or would like something added then please <a href="contact_us.htm">contact us</a>.</p>
          <p>Flagstaff Hill currently offer three Senior sides: A Grade and B Grade (played on Saturdays) and C Grade (played on Sundays). This provides a great opportunity for all standards of players as well as catering for those who work on Saturdays and can only play on a Sunday.</p>
          <p>Junior success has been a constant throughout the last decade at the Falcons and we are just starting to see this transfer into better Senior performances, with consistent Finals appearances over the past three seasons for ALL grades, including Grand Final appearances for B Grade in 2014 and Grand Final appearances for A Grade & C Grade in 2016 resulting in Premierships.</p>
          <p class="centered"><img src="../pictures/AGrade2016Flag.jpg" width="600px" /></p>
          <p><span class="newsHeaderSmall">A Grade</span><br />The A Grade have worked hard over the past few years which has resulted in Semi Finals in 2014, Preliminary Final in 2015 (after finishing minor Premiers) and the ultimate a Grand Final apearance in 2016. The Grand Final was a hard fought contest against the Minor Premiers Morphett Vale (Falcons finished 4th at the end of the Minor Round) however the Falcons came out on top & won the Final by 13 points, resulting in their first A Grade Premiership success since the Club's remarkable undefeated season in 1985.</p>
          <p>2016 A Grade Premiership Coach Rod Mitchell will continue to take the reins in 2017 and is looking forward to the season ahead. Rod will be supported in the coaches box by Darren Vanzetta, Donny Aldridge and Brenton Kirk whilst Jack Starkey will be the new Team Manager and Michael Haslam will be the Runner.</p>
	      <p>The A Grade train on Tuesday and Thursday nights starting at 6:30pm at the Flagstaff Hill Oval, their games take place on Saturdays at 2:30pm unless otherwise specified in the SFL Program.</p>

Kym will be assisted by Marty Clifford & Tim O'Malley continues on as Team Manager. The B Grade train with the A Grade and their matches commence at 12:50pm on Saturdays unless otherwise stated by the SFL.</p>
	      <p>After taking home the Premiership in 2013 and falling agonisingly short in 2014,2015 and 2016 Kym and the Falcons B Grade will be eager to return to the top in 2017 as we continue to promote Junior development with some exciting former Juniors now seeking Senior selection in 2017.</p>

The C Grade competition offers an opportunity for those that are unavailable for Saturday selection or who have missed out on selection for the B Grade, to still play football in the red and the blue.</p>
          <p>The C Grade also trains on Tuesday and Thursdays with the other Senior Teams and their games take place on Sundays, kicking off at 1:00pm unless otherwise specified in the SFL Program.</p>
