          <p>Flagstaff Hill currently offer six Sunday sides (2x Under 8s, 2x Under 10s & 2x Under 12s).  This provides a great opportunity for all ages and allows families to enjoy a great social atmosphere on a Sunday morning.  At the Falcons we also welcome any girls that are interested in playing football to come out and join in, girls are welcome to play in any of the three Subbies age groups.</p>

<p><span class="newsHeaderSmall">Under 8s</span><br />For players in the Under 8s it can be a scary time, coming to a Football Club for the first time and sometimes playing with a whole bunch of new teammates, but at the Falcons we pride ourselves on making sure, to the best of our ability, that everyone is fitting in and enjoying their football.</p>
          <p>The Under 8s train on Friday nights at the Flagstaff Hill Football Club from 6:00pm to 7:30pm and games are played on Sunday morning at 9:00am.  Please remember that all players will need a mouthguard, navy blue shorts and red socks.</p>

          <p><span class="newsHeaderSmall">Subbies Fees</span><br />It costs over $150,000 to run our Football Club each year plus thousands of hours of work provided free of charge by volunteers.  Paying your membership fees on time is a small way for you to show respect to your Club, to your team mates and to those volunteers whose efforts allow you to play football each week.</p>
          <p>Currently the fees are $110* for Sub-Juniors.  At the Flagstaff Hill Football Club we have a 'No Pay, No Play' policy - "if any player has not paid their subs in full or entered into a payment plan with the Treasurer by the first game, then that player will be ineligible to play until the fees are paid in full".</p>
          <p>* $5 of the $110 is a 'end of season levy' which will be used to purchase presents for the coaches.  This saves a lot of hassle for the coordinators who normally have to chase this up at the end of the season.  $20 of the $110 is a raffle book levy.</p>
          <p><span class="newsHeaderSmall">Where We Play</span><br />
